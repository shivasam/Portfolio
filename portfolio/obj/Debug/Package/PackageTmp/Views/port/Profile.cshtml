                                I am Shiva Jaligama, I earned master of science degree in major Computer and
                                Information Sciences from Kent State University in May 2017. I have couple of
                                intern work experience in .NET platform. Right from start of my coursework
                                I have done various projects on .net platform, I am trying to focus and develop my
                                skills to work on real time projects.
                                Coming to my personal interest. Most of the time I would spend my time on surfing
                                internet. I am pretty much excited to know the things going around and keep me learning new things.
                                This is one of the basic interest since my childhood which made me to develop interest on programming.
                                Other than computer, I always spend rest of the time with my pet.
                                This dog always put my stress far away and I enjoy it.
